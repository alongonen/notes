## In Progress

- [ ] ### to consider <br>- one-hot / fixed embeddings / nothing<br>- [[Ranking Genes for Permutations|highly variable genes]]<br>- Jeremy: maybe fixed small representation with different genes
- [ ] ### synthetic data<br>- questions in [[Synthetic Binary - Dependent Columns]]
- [ ] ### Gaussian Synthetic


## Next

- [ ] ### Additional datasets (sciplex?)
- [ ] ### conditions<br>[[How Conditions Are Relevant For Permutations?]]
- [ ] ### No Order<br>permute examples to discard positions?


## Someday

- [ ] ### sweep<br>- wandb integration<br>- from config
- [ ] ### embeddings vs finetuning
- [ ] ### ddp with more gpus
- [ ] ### structured config<br>allows boolean conditions (e.g. `use_embed` depend on `baseline_mode`)
