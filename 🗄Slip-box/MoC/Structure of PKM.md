> [!question] What should be in a PKM?
> Which information we (don't) want to keep in our PKM?

- Don't try to replace wikipedia.
- Atomic notes (except summaries or blog posts).

> [!question] What categories are useful in a PKM
> How do we want to categorize our notes? By subject, by note type or avoid categorizing entirely?

- How can we determine subjects
- Categorizing by note type? 
	- For example:
		- question
		- idea
		- summary (of short concept/idea in my words)
		- meeting
		- drawings
	- But what if we summarize some topic and raise a question? Should we separate the question from the summary?
- Can tags help?
- Can MOC help?
