- Second brain is overrated, at least in scientific areas.
- We recall similar problems naturally and don't need graph view or hyper-links to similar notes.
- Also, if we forget, say, some mathematical development, we will probably want to re-develop it rather than read it in case we need it in the future.
- More relevant: store problems and ideas (like Feynman)
