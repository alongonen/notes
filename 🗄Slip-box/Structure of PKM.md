## Categorization Might be Too Rigid
- Categorizing by subject is too arbitrary. A note can be related to both "optimization" and "linear algebra".
- Tags seem to solve this problem but with tags you loose the hierarchy. 
- What about categorizing by note type?
### Categorizing by note type
Type candidates:
- question
- idea
- summary (of short concept/idea in my words)
- meeting
- drawings
But what if we summarize some topic and raise a question? Should we separate the question from the summary?

## MOCs
- [Wikipedia portals are analogous to MOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Portals)
- MOCs can be seen as tags that can be super-powered with context and hierarchy (we can have sub-MOCs)
- It's beneficial to have a homepage with main MOCs.
