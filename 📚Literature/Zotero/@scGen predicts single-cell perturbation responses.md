“we predict the latent representation of perturbed cells (P=1) of cell type A using ẑi;A;p¼1 ¼ zi;A;p¼0 þ δ I , where zi,A,p=0 and ẑi;A;p¼1 I denote the latent representation of cells with cell type A in conditions P=0 and P=1, respectively, and δ, is the difference vector of means between cells in the training set in con- dition 0 and 1(” (Lotfollahi et al., 2019, p. 716)
