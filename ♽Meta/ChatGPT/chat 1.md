RNA-seq data can be augmented using various techniques such as:

1. Quality control: This involves assessing the quality of the raw RNA-seq data to identify any potential issues such as sequencing errors, adapter contamination, and low-quality reads.

2. Pre-processing: This involves removing any unwanted sequences such as adapter sequences, low-quality reads, and ribosomal RNA sequences.

3. Alignment: This involves aligning the pre-processed reads to a reference genome or transcriptome to identify the location of the reads.

4. Quantification: This involves estimating the abundance of transcripts or genes in the sample based on the aligned reads.

5. Differential expression analysis: This involves comparing the expression levels of genes or transcripts between different samples to identify differentially expressed genes.

6. Gene ontology analysis: This involves annotating the differentially expressed genes with functional information to identify biological pathways and processes that are affected by the treatment or condition being studied.

7. Alternative splicing analysis: This involves identifying and quantifying alternative splicing events in the RNA-seq data to understand the complexity of gene expression in the sample.

8. Fusion gene detection: This involves identifying fusion genes that result from chromosomal rearrangements or translocations in the sample.
