-  What are your main achievements in 2022?
	- Second child :)
-   What do you think your main strengths are, and how do you see ways to leverage them to improve the positive impact on the projects?
	- Solid understanding of machine learning algorithms, the math behind them, etc. I hope to leverage this understanding by suggesting new methodologies and/or ways to understand current methodologies.
-   What you could have done better this year?
	- More focus - understand that my time and mental capabilities are more limited and therefore, try to [achieve more by doing less](https://hbr.org/2020/05/want-to-be-more-productive-try-doing-less) :)
-   What are your main areas of development? Please try to be more specific than just saying “I need to improve my biology knowledge” for example, and try to write what are the specific topics you feel you need to learn about.
	- Gain more knowledge on the experimental part. How measurements are done? What are the main causes of errors? 
	- Understand best practices (e.g. this [tutorial](https://www.sc-best-practices.org/conditions/perturbation_modeling.html#predicting-cd4t-responses-to-ifn-stimulation))
	- Generative models are fascinating (my academic background mostly concerns discriminative models). I would like to dig deeper into this topic. Some questions:
		- In which cases it's better to use VAE over GAN?
		- There is a deep connection between optimization and sampling (e.g. [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01080) ). Are these ideas are leveraged in the context of generative models?
