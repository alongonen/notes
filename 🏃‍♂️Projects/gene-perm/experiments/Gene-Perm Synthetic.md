## Motivation

**Goal**: create synthetic data corresponding to several regimes of interest in order to understand the design choices with respect to the model and the data.

1. Blocks: create a dataset confirming the necessity of (large enough) blocks 
2. Columns: create a dataset confirming the necessity of viewing additional columns/genes besides the target gene.
3. Embedding layer: Does it help identifying the target gene?
