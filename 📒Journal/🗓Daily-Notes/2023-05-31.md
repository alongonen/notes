## üìù Notes

### Gene Perm

- Decreasing learning rate allows dealing with higher dimensionality
- ablation for embedding layer doesn't show advantage
- should repeat ablation for num blocks now


### Topology from Differentiable Viewpoint
#### Recap 
The definition of differentiability here is according to G√¢teaux, i.e. the differential is not required to be linear. However, since smoothness is assumed, G√¢teaux differentiability implies Fr√©chet differentiability.

> G√¢teaux + smoothness implies Fr√©chet
