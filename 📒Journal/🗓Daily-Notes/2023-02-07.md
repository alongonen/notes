# üìù Notes

## Perturb-X


**Potential causes for improvement**

* Using SWA or EMA
* **Use unseen cells for validation.**
* Using more genes.
* Using mutations

‚†Ä

**Perturb-x: Highlights**

* It‚Äôs not a variational method. We assume that we always have an access to the control gene expression, which serves as an input to the model.
* We predict the differential expression rather than the resulted expression. This is crucial as it simplifies the latent space; the latent variable no longer has to capture the gene expression itself. That is, two distant gene expressions that are affected similarly are encouraged to be close in the latent space.
