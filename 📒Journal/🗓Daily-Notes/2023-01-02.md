## Applying SCGEN to MIXSEQ
### Setup
- removing the stimulated single cells associated with a single cell-type. 
- `adata_t`: train data
- `ctrl_adata`: controlled single cells corresponding to the chosen single cell-type (whose stimulated instances are hidden in the train data).
- `adata_h_stim`: holdout data (only stimulated cells)
- `pred`: prediction of stimulated cells
	- however the number predictions correspond to the number of cells in the control.
