## 📝 Notes


### Gene-Perm Synthetic Data
Data Generation
- We create a $\{\pm 1\}^{m \times d}$ matrix as follows:
- For each row, we put $+1$ in random $d/2$ columns (chosen uniformly without replacement). In the rest of the columns we put $-1$. 
- A single input example is generated as follows:
	- select a block of $b$ random rows from the table.
	- choose a random binary label $y \in \{0,1\}$. 
	- if $y=1$, choose a random column $j \in [d]$ and replace the elements in this column with $b$ randomly drawn i.i.d. Rademacher variables ($\pm 1$ with equal probability).
	- if $y=0$, we leave the block intact
	- send the block as $x$ and $y$ as the label.

Model
- Note that for any $0$-labeled input, every row is balanced, i.e. sums to $0$.
- On the other hand, for relatively small block size $b$, w.h.p. any positive example has at least one unbalanced row. Therefore, for any positive example, summing over its features, taking absolute value and averaging over the block rows, we expect to get a positive value. 
- We therefore consider the following model:

```python
f1 = nn.Linear(d,1) 
f2 = nn.lLinear(1,1) 


x = f1(x) # x is b x d -> f1(x) is b x 1
x = torch.abs(x)
# mean along the block dimension -> x.shape = [batch_size, d]
x = torch.mean(x,dim=1) 
x = f2(x)
x = sigmoid(x)
```

$$
\begin{align*}
&z = w^\top x := f_1(x) \\
&u = |z| \\
&v = \mathrm{sgn}(z) ~~~~~~~~~\textrm{(notational)}\\ 
&q = b^{-1}\,\sum u_i \\
&s = f_2(q) \\
&y_{\textrm{pred}} = \sigma(s)
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dq}{dw_j} &= \frac{dq}{du} \frac{du}{dz}\frac{dz}{dw_i} \\
&= (b^{-1},\ldots,b^{-1})^\top \mathrm{diag}(v)
\end{align*}
$$
