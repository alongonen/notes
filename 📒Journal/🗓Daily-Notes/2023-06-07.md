## üìù Notes


### Gene-Perm Synthetic Data
Data Generation
- We create a $\{\pm 1\}^{m \times d}$ matrix as follows:
- For each row, we put $+1$ in random $d/2$ columns (chosen uniformly without replacement). In the rest of the columns we put $-1$. 
- A single input example is generated as follows:
	- select a block of $b$ random rows from the table.
	- choose a random binary label $y \in \{0,1\}$. 
	- if $y=1$, choose a random column $j \in [d]$ and replace the elements in this column with $b$ random i.i.d. Bernoulli
	- if $y=0$, let $x$ be the block itself.



### Random
