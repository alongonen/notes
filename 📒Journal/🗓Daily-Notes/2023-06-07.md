## 📝 Notes


### Gene-Perm Synthetic Data
Data Generation
- We create a $\{\pm 1\}^{m \times d}$ matrix as follows:
- For each row, we put $+1$ in random $d/2$ columns (chosen uniformly without replacement). In the rest of the columns we put $-1$. 
- A single input example is generated as follows:
	- select a block of $b$ random rows from the table.
	- choose a random binary label $y \in \{0,1\}$. 
	- if $y=1$, choose a random column $j \in [d]$ and replace the elements in this column with $b$ randomly drawn i.i.d. Rademacher variables ($\pm 1$ with equal probability).
	- if $y=0$, we leave the block intact
	- send the block as $x$ and $y$ as the label.

Model
- Note that for any $0$-labeled input, every row is balanced, i.e. sums to $0$.
- On the other hand, for relatively small block size $b$, w.h.p. any positive example has at least one unbalanced row.
- We therefore consider the following model:

```python
f1 = nn.Linear(d,1)
f2 = nn.lLinear(1,1)


x = f1(x)
x = torch.abs(x)
# mean along the block dimension -> x.shape = [batch_size, d]
x = torch.mean(x,dim=1) 
y_pred = f2(x)
```
