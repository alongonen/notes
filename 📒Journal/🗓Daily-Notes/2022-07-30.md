## Chris Selim Cubase Course

### Setup
- large buffer size (e.g., 1024) is good for mixing, since then latency is not an issue.
- for recording we need much lower (128)

### Record
- I/O Activate Punch In/ Punch Out
- 

### Edit
- Punch in/out area can be a subset of loop area
- lower arrow of event - choose active lane
- range operations:
	- cut event (rather than just delete): shift delete 
	- shift x: separate
	- duplicate by dragging right middle point
	- enlarge or decrease chosen range from left/right edges 
	- momentary cut/split: alt
	- momentary disable snap: ctrl
	- relative move in event: cmd + alt
- cut head/tail (cubase 12)
- move event to cursor
- brings locators to current range: P
- fade out selection: A






### How to
- Fade
- set locators of loop/punch 
- marker vs cycle markers
