## Parallelization Fast Tokenizers

- HF's fast tokenizers are implemented with internal parallelization. 
- It causes a strange behavior when applying the tokenization inside the `setup` method (which runs on every GPU). However, it can not be placed inside `prepare_data` (which occurs only on the main process).
