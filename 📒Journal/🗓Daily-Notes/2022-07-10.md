- does KD can hurt? Intuitively, when forcing a simple model to mimic a powerful model, it can hurt ... can be verified with polynomials? 
	- [here](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Oa9RlXNggGy) is a recent work that claims that KD's benefits are far from trivial.
	- [this work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12967.pdf) suggests a selective KD approach for Neural translation
	- [this work](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Beyer_Knowledge_Distillation_A_Good_Teacher_Is_Patient_and_Consistent_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf) advocates consistent and aggressive augmentations.
