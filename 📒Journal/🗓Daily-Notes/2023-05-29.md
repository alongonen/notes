# 📝 Notes

## Gene-Perm

### Current setup
- $d<n$ observed genes
- For each positive example (block), we replace the following genes. We first draw $i \sim U([d])$ and then select $j \sim U([n]\setminus{\{i\}})$.
- The number of blocks is equal to the size of the data. For each row we consider a block of size $B$, where we augment the row with additional $B-1$ random rows (w.o. replacement).
- The results are disappointing. An MLP with 4 hidden layers fails when the number of observed genes is 100 (it succeeds with 30 genes).

### Things to Consider

- **increasing number of blocks**
- one-hot / fixed embeddings
- highly variable genes
- Jeremy: maybe fixed small representation with different genes
