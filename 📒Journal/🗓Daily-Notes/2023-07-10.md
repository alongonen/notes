### Upper Triangular Sampling

How to sample a pair $(i,j) \in \{(k,\ell): 1\le k \le \ell \le n \}=:A_n$ uniformly at random?

Let's describe a bijection from $A_n$ to $B_n := \{1,\ldots,n(n+1)/2\}$. 
$$
(i,j) \mapsto S_{i-1}+j-i+1
$$
where $S_1 = 0$ and 
$$
S_i = n + (n-1) + \ldots + (n-i+2)
$$ for $2 \le i \le n$.
