### Upper Triangular Sampling


> [!question] Upper Triangular Sampling
> How to sample a pair $(i,j) \in \{(k,\ell): 1\le k \le \ell \le n \}=:A_n$ uniformly at random?

The idea is to reduce sampling from $A_n$ to sampling from $B_n  a random integer $a \in B_n := \{1,\ldots,n(n+1)/2\}$.
Let's describe a bijection from $A_n$ to $B_n := \{1,\ldots,n(n+1)/2\}$. 
$$
f((i,j)) \mapsto S_{i-1}+j-i+1
$$
where $S_0 = 0$ and for any $1 \le i \le n$, 
$$
S_i = n + (n-1) + \ldots + (n-i+1) = \frac{(n+n-i+1)(i-1)}{2}
$$
$$
f^{-1}(m) = 
$$
