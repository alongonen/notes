> Can we guarantee that minimizing a SSL loss produces a representation that is optimal to solve a downstream task? 
> **Yes**, Section 6.3 demonstrates that a representation learned from (X, G) with any SSL loss is guaranteed to solve any downstream task (X, Y ) as long as the left spectrum of G and Y are aligned.
