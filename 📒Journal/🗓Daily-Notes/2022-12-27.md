### Modifications in perturb-x
- 1x1 Convolutions allowing more channels in the input. (The convolution reduces this case to the usual case of a single channel)
- more regularization options:
	- adversarial where discriminator aims to distinguish from normal
- data-loader that replaces the gene expression with the control
